'Movie Book' app (beta name)

Overview Movie Book App is designed to solve the indecisiveness often faced when choosing movies. Built with TypeScript and Next.js, it provides a robust, user-friendly interface powered by the App Router and styled using Tailwind CSS. The app integrates data from The Movie Database (TMDb) API, along with APIs from various streaming services, to offer a personalized movie selection experience.

Key Features

Personalized Movie Search: Users can search for and add their favorite movies to their profile, using data sourced from TMDb API.

Integration with Streaming Services: The app will connect with multiple streaming service APIs, allowing users to view their liked or watchlisted films from these platforms in one place.

AI-Powered Movie Matching: Utilizing AI, the app will compare user profiles with those of a friend or partner to suggest movies that suit both parties' preferences.

Mood-Based Suggestions: The app will take into account the current mood of users, offering movie recommendations that align with how they're feeling.

Technologies Used

TypeScript: Ensures type safety and enhances the development experience with static type checking. Next.js: Provides a framework for server-side rendering, improving SEO and performance. App Router: Manages routing in the Next.js environment, offering a seamless navigation experience. Tailwind CSS: Utilized for styling, offering a utility-first approach for a customizable and responsive design.

Getting Started To get started with the app, users need to create an account and input their movie preferences. This includes linking their streaming service accounts to import their liked films.

How the AI Works

The AI algorithm will compare the movie preferences and watch histories of two users to find commonalities and differences. It then analyses mood inputs to filter suggestions, ensuring the recommended movies align with both users' tastes and current emotional state.

Future Enhancements Broader API Integration: Plans to incorporate more streaming service APIs for a wider range of movie options. Advanced AI Features: Enhancing the AI to consider more nuanced user preferences and viewing habits.
